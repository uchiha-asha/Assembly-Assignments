Assignment-1: Area Under Curve Using MIPS

1. Run the file "A1_area.asm" and input the values as per the specifications.
2. The test cases are provided in the folder A1_TestCases as "A1_Test1.in" through "A1_Test8.in".
3. The corresponding outputs are stored in "A1_Test_out.out".
4. The file "A1_TestCases/checker.py" contains the python code to find the area under the curve.

Input:: An integer n denoting the number of test cases and 2n lines containing x- and y-coordinates of the n points (arranged in ascending order)
Output:: Single line outputting the area under the points joined by straight lines and x-axis.
